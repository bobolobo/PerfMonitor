# PerfMonitor
Python-based Performance Monitor which mimics Windows built-in Perfmon, only better :)  

It also monitors certain processes to watch how many times (hopefully none) they restart.  
We collect all product performance stats but give the User a graphic option to pick the actual stats to report on.

To run need to install psutil, numpy, mathplotlib, and winstats python libraries.
